### Project Description:
The success of neural methods for image captioning suggests that similar benefits can be reaped for generating captions for information
visualizations. In this preliminary study, we focus on the very popular line charts. We propose a neural model which aims to
generate text from the same data used to create a line chart. Due to the lack of suitable training corpora, we collected a dataset through crowdsourcing. Experiments indicate that our model outperforms relatively simple non-neural baselines.
